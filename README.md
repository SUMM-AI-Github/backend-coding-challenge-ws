# SUMM backend coding challenge

As the next step in our interview process, we'd like you to complete a small coding challenge.

## The project

You will build a small backend with the Django Framework.

The goal is to be able to use all CRUD operations on the two models 'translation' and 'user'. You can neglect authentication for using the api endpoints.

A translation object is a simple object consisting of the attributes:

| Attribute  | Datatype |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Id         | Integer  |
| InputText  | String   |
| OutputText | String   |
| FromUserId | Integer  |

A user object consists of the following attributes:
| Attribute | Datatype |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Id | Integer |
| Name | String |
| QuotaLimit | Integer |
| QuotaSpent | Integer |

## Additional Information

- Here is a small tutorial of how to build a Django app: https://realpython.com/django-setup/
- using ORM for DB operations
- Test your code
- You can use all external libraries you find
- Have fun and do not overengineer it
- show us your skills in the commits that you have a clear structure in the code
- Reach out to me (Nicholas) if you have any questions

## Evaluation criteria

- Functionality
- Code quality
- Test quality

## How to submit

1. Create a new repo (public or private where you invite me, as you like)
2. Work on your solution (create meaningful commits; best to finish the project in one session so we can
   better review the commits)
3. (optional) Deploy the app using your preferred hosting service (heroku, etc.)
4. Send me a link of your repo to submit

## Timeframe

There is no time limit for the challenge. You will
not be judged on how quickly you complete the challenge.
